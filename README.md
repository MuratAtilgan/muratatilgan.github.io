# Murat Atilgan — Digital Portfolio  
Welcome to my professional portfolio, where 22 years of business leadership meet the next chapter in technology.

## About Me  
I’m currently a first-year Computer Science student at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS), combining two decades of strategic business experience with a clear goal: to master cloud infrastructure and modern software systems. Early in my tech journey, I completed courses in C++ and HTML, laying the groundwork for my shift into full-stack and cloud engineering.

My passion is building systems that scale—both technically and organizationally. I focus on **cloud-native architectures, DevOps, Infrastructure as Code**, and I’m actively exploring AI/ML models and data systems. I believe that true value lies not just in writing code but in designing reliable, resilient infrastructure that solves real business challenges.

## What You’ll Find Here  
- **Portfolio Website** – showcases my personal brand, projects, and professional narrative in a clean, dark-theme layout.  
- **Python Learning Journey** – weekly snapshots of my programming progression: labs, exercises, mini-projects, and growing code fluency.  
- **Web Development Work** – real life HTML/CSS/JS pages including a themed site and responsive layout work.  
- **Database & Systems Projects** – early work in data management, network design, and system architecture.  
- **AI & ML Exploration** – experiments with model training, data pipelines and future-ready infrastructure.  
- **Business Strategy Meets Tech** – insights on how my business background informs my technical design thinking and architecture decisions.

## Why This Portfolio Matters  
Transitioning from business leadership into computing is more than a career change—it’s a strategic evolution. Every folder, every code snippet, every deployment you see here reflects my commitment to build, learn, and adapt with purpose. Whether you’re a recruiter, collaborator, or peer, I hope this site gives you clear insight into both *what* I do and *why* I’m doing it.
